<h4><strong>With the launch of ECOS, will there be changes in the IRB review structure for NHG DSRB?</strong></h4>
<p>Although NHG DSRB will be using a common IRB review platform (ECOS) as
SingHealth CIRB, both IRBs will continue to function as independent Institution
Review Boards.</p>
<p>If there are cross cluster studies, the IRB review will be done in accordance
with the current mutual recognition / cooperative agreements.&nbsp;</p>
