<p>The <strong>Ethics and Compliance Online System (ECOS)</strong> is the new
ethics review infrastructure that is co-developed by NHG and SingHealth.
Launched on 10 May 2024, the ECOS system replaces the previous NHG ROAM
system.
<br>
<br>The ECOS system is intended to support research enterprise functions across
the research lifecycle from Study Initiation to Completion, allowing IRBs,
institutions, and researchers to have a one stop oversight of research
related activities.
<br>
<br>ECOS is now available with the following modules:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Institutional Review Board (IRB) Module</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Researcher Minimum Training Module</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical Research Management System (CRMS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) (NHG-only) Module</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>All of the announcements, news and user guides related to the ECOS system
will be made available here on this&nbsp;website. Alternatively, you can
