<p>The <strong>Ethics and Compliance Online System (ECOS)</strong> is the new
ethics review infrastructure that is co-developed by NHG and SingHealth.
Launched on 10 May 2024, the ECOS system replaces the previous NHG ROAM
system.
<br>
<br>The ECOS system is intended to support research enterprise functions across
the research lifecycle from Study Initiation to Completion, allowing IRBs,
institutions, and researchers to have a one stop oversight of research
related activities.
<br>
<br>ECOS is now available with the following modules:</p>
<p>• Minimum Training</p>
<p>• IRB</p>
<p>• Clinical Research Management System (CRMS)</p>
<p>• Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) (NHG specific)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Features such as the Export and Track Change functions will be available
to users at a later time.&nbsp;Quality &amp; Compliance modules are being
developed to launch in the latter part of 2024.
<br>
<br>Ongoing IRB approved studies in ROAM and iSHaRE are also being transited
into ECOS in parts.&nbsp;Please refrain from editing these migrating studies
in ECOS as your work may not be saved.
<br>
<br>To expedite the transit, ECOS may also be unavailable on weekends, public
holidays and after office hours (7pm-7am) in May.
<br>
<br>All posted announcements, news and guides related to the ECOS system will
be made available here on this&nbsp;portal.</p>
